You must respond with only a valid JSON object. Do not include explanations, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Extract the following information from the provided text:

- "copyrights": A list of **explicit copyright statements**. These must:
  - Contain the word "copyright", or the symbols "(C)", "(c)", or "©"
  - Preserve formatting exactly as in the original, including tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`)
  - **Not** include any comment-related syntax like `/*`, `*/`, `//`, or `*` at the start of lines
  - Include remarks like "All rights reserved." if part of the original statement
- "holders": Names of copyright holders (individuals or entities), even if they are not part of an explicit copyright statement
- "authors": Names of authors mentioned in the text, if any

Output format:

{
  "copyrights": [],
  "holders": [],
  "authors": []
}

Use this policy for extraction:

**Identification Policy**
- Authors are individuals or entities contributing written or creative material.
- Holders are individuals or entities legally holding the rights to the material.
- Copyright statements are markings asserting legal ownership, explicitly containing "copyright", "©", "(C)", or "(c)", and typically including names and years.

**Extraction Policy**
- Do not modify copyright statements in content or formatting. Extract them exactly as written.
- Strip only comment boundaries (like `//`, `*`, `/*`) from the extracted lines.
- Preserve all internal structure (including `All rights reserved.` if present).
